Css Notes:-

Common Block Elemenets in CSS
    - <p>, Headers(<h1> to <h6>), divisions(<div>), Lists and list items(<ol>, <ul>, and <li>), Forms(<form>)

Display properties:-
    - Block, Inline, Inline-Block, None
    - You can also use visiblility:hidden instead of display:None
        - Diff between visiblility and display(None):-
            - Display removes the place of the element as well
            - visiblility only hides the element but the place taken by the element is not removed.

Css Positioning:-
    - Content is Everything.
    - Order Comes from Code.
    - Children sit on parents.
 - Position
   - Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed
 - Coordinates
   - Top, Bottom, Left, Right

- We can Center the text by using text-align property or through margin
- font-size 16px = 100% = 1em
- rem in font-size means ignore the parent font-size and use child font-size e.g(font-size: 2rem)
